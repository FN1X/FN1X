## Hi there üëã I'm FN1X!

![8Bit purple space sky, with the text "your struggles are over"](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2049752674268264814/904D3DDD305EED4404FA257414EC2146BDBAE36E/?imw=1024&imh=680&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true)

I'm just anter person on the internet who tries to treat everyone with kindness and do my best to live life. I have amnesia and some other stuff which makes it a little hard for me to do lotta stuff, but I remain undefeated. ^^ 

I mainly love anything that has technology in it. Wether it be phones, computers, cars, etc etc.. That is why i would love to work on cars, do IT, maybe get into bug hunting and if the other stuff don't work maybe become an electrician or something. 

So yeah, thanks for checking my page! If you are interested, have any questions or just wanna be friends, I left my socials at the bottom. So feel free to contact me! And you better be nice, or I will ```sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root /``` your life hehehehe.
